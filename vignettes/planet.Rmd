## Installation

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("planet")
```

## Cell composition

To infer cell composition on placental villi DNAm samples, we can need to use
placental reference cpgs [(Yuan 2021)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07186-6). These are provided in this package as
`plCellCpGsThird` and `plCellCpGsFirst` for third trimester (term) and
first trimester samples, respectively.

In this example we are using term villi DNAm data, so we first load the 
reference cpgs `plCellCpGsThird`. This is a data frame of 600 cpgs, with 
mean methylation levels for each cell type.

```{r load_libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# cell deconvolution packages
library(minfi)
library(EpiDISH)

# data wrangling and plotting
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(planet)

# load example data
data("plBetas")
data("plCellCpGsThird")
head(plCellCpGsThird)
```

After our reference cpg data is loaded, we can estimate cell composition by
applying either the Constrained Projection approach implemented by the R 
packages minfi or EpiDISH, or a non-constrained approach by EpiDish. I demonstrate
how to do both.

#### Minfi

```{r houseman}
houseman_estimates <- minfi:::projectCellType(
  plBetas[rownames(plCellCpGsThird), ],
  plCellCpGsThird,
  lessThanOne = FALSE
)

head(houseman_estimates)
```

#### EpiDISH

```{r epidish, results='hide'}
# robust partial correlations
epidish_RPC <- epidish(
  beta.m = plBetas[rownames(plCellCpGsThird), ],
  ref.m = plCellCpGsThird,
  method = "RPC"
)

# CIBERSORT
epidish_CBS <- epidish(
  beta.m = plBetas[rownames(plCellCpGsThird), ],
  ref.m = plCellCpGsThird,
  method = "CBS"
)

# constrained projection (houseman 2012)
epidish_CP <- epidish(
  beta.m = plBetas[rownames(plCellCpGsThird), ],
  ref.m = plCellCpGsThird,
  method = "CP"
)
```

#### Compare

Below, I demonstrate how we can visually compare the different cell composition 
estimates.

```{r compare_deconvolution, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
data("plColors")

# bind estimate data frames and reshape for plotting
bind_rows(
  houseman_estimates %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(algorithm = "CP (Houseman)"),
  epidish_RPC$estF %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(algorithm = "RPC"),
  epidish_CBS$estF %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(algorithm = "CBS"),
  epidish_CP$estF %>% as.data.frame() %>% mutate(algorithm = "CP (EpiDISH)")
) %>%
  mutate(sample = rep(rownames(houseman_estimates), 4)) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(algorithm, sample),
    names_to = "component",
    values_to = "estimate"
  ) %>%
  
  # relevel for plot
  mutate(component = factor(component,
                            levels = c(
                              "nRBC", "Endothelial", "Hofbauer",
                              "Stromal", "Trophoblasts",
                              "Syncytiotrophoblast"
                            )
  )) %>%
  
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = estimate, fill = component)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~algorithm, ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = plColors) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-0.1, 1.1), breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1),
    labels = scales::percent
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(x = "", fill = "")
```

Some notes:

* Normalize your data with `minfi::preprocessNoob` and BMIQ
* Use all cell CpGs - if some are missing, estimates may vary
* If your samples have been processed in a particular manner, (e.g. sampling 
from maternal side) expect cell composition to reflect that

## Gestational age

#### Example Data

For demonstration, I use 24 samples from a placental DNAm dataset from GEO,
([GSE7519](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75196)), which
contains samples collected in an Australian population. The DNA methylation 
data (in betas) can be accessed with `data(plBetas)` and corresponding sample
information from `data(plPhenoData)`. Note that for demonstration purposes, the 
cpgs have been filtered to a random \~10,000 CpGs, plus the CpGs used in all of 
the functions from this package.

```{r gestational_age}
# load example data
data(plBetas)
data(plPhenoData)

dim(plBetas)
#> [1] 13918    24
head(plPhenoData)
#> # A tibble: 6 x 7
#>   sample_id  sex   disease   gestation_wk ga_RPC ga_CPC ga_RRPC
#>   <fct>      <chr> <chr>            <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 GSM1944936 Male  preeclam~           36   38.5   38.7    38.7

#> 6 GSM1944948 Fema~ preeclam~           36   36.8   38.4    36.7
```

There are 3 gestational age clocks for placental DNA methylation data from [(Lee 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628997/):

1.  Robust Placental Clock (RPC)
2.  Control Placental Clock (CPC)
3.  Refined Robust Placental Clock (RRPC)

To predict gestational, we load the example data:

- `plBetas` - DNAm data for 24 placental samples
- `plPhenoData` - Matching sample information

#### Predict Gestational Age

To select the type of clock, we can specify the `type` argument in `predictAge`.

We will apply all three clocks on this data, and add the predicted age to the
sample information data.frame, `plPhenoData`.

```{r predict_ga}
plPhenoData <- plPhenoData %>%
  mutate(
    ga_RPC = predictAge(plBetas, type = "RPC"),
    ga_CPC = predictAge(plBetas, type = "CPC"),
    ga_RRPC = predictAge(plBetas, type = "RRPC")
  )
```

Note that the number of predictors (CpGs) that were used in our data are 
printed. It's important to take note if a significant number of predictive CpGs
are missing in your data, as this can affect the predicted gestational age
accuracy.

Next, I plot the difference between predicted and reported gestational age, for
each of the 3 gestational age predictors.

```{r view_ga, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plPhenoData %>%
  
  # reshape, to plot
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains("ga"),
    names_to = "clock_type",
    names_prefix = "ga_",
    values_to = "ga"
  ) %>%
  
  # plot code
  ggplot(aes(x = gestation_wk, y = ga, col = disease)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~clock_type) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(x = "Reported GA (weeks)", y = "Inferred GA (weeks)", col = "")
```

## Ethnicity

Before predicting ethnicity You can ensure that you have all features using the
`ethnicityCpGs` vector:

```{r ethnicity}
data(ethnicityCpGs)
all(ethnicityCpGs %in% rownames(plBetas))

results <- predictEthnicity(plBetas)
results %>%
  tail(8)
```

`predictEthnicity` returns probabilities corresponding to each ethnicity for
each sample (e.g `Prob_Caucasian`, `Prob_African`, `Prob_Asian`). This applies a
glmnet model described in [(Yuan 2019)](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-019-0296-3). A final classification is determined in two ways:

1.  `Predicted_ethnicity_nothresh` - returns a classification corresponding to
the highest class-specific probability.

2.  `Predicted_ethnicity` - if the highest class-specific probability is below
`0.75`, then the the sample is assigned an `Amibiguous` label. This threshold 
can be adjusted with the `threshold` argument. Samples with this label might
require special attention in downstream analyses.


```{r, fig.width = 7}
results %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Prob_Caucasian, y = Prob_African,
    col = Predicted_ethnicity
  )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = "P(Caucasian)", y = "P(African)")

results %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Prob_Caucasian, y = Prob_Asian,
    col = Predicted_ethnicity
  )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = "P(Caucasian)", y = "P(Asian)")
```

We can't compare this to self-reported ethnicity as it is unavailable. But we
know these samples were collected in Sydney, Australia, and are therefore 
likely mostly European with some East Asian participants.


```{r}
table(results$Predicted_ethnicity)
```

**A note on adjustment in differential methylation analysis**

Because 'Ambiguous' samples might have different mixtures of ancestries, it 
might be inadequate to adjust for them as one group in an analysis of admixed
populations (e.g. 50/50 Asian/African should not be considered the same group 
as 50/50 Caucasian/African). One solution would be to simply remove these
samples. Another would be to adjust for the raw probabilities-in this case, use
only two of the three probabilities, since the third will be redundant
(probabilities sum to 1). If sample numbers are large enough in each group,
stratifying downstream analyses by ethnicity might also be a valid option.

## Early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE)

To calculate the probability of EOPE of placental DNAm chorionic villi samples, 
we rely on 45 predictive CpGs. 

In this example, we load the validation data used in [Fern√°ndez-Boyano 2023](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.17.23290125v1)] and 
estimate the EOPE probability of the samples. Note that the function must 
be run on a matrix with the full set of CpG probes in either the 
450K or 850K arrays - the reason for this is that all 45 predictive CpGs must 
be present for prediction to be completed. 

It is recommended that data is normalized using BMIQ prior to prediction. 

Note that samples must be rows and CpGs must be columns. The default threshold 
for classification used to assign labels is 55%; if the users wishes to use 
other threshold, different labels can be assigned based on the output 
probabilities. 

```{r predict_pe, include=TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(ExperimentHub)
eh <- ExperimentHub()
query(eh, "eoPredData")

# download BMIQ normalized 450k data
x_test <- eh[['EH8403']]
preds <- x_test %>% predictPreeclampsia()
```

Inspect the results:

```{r include=TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 7}
head(preds)

# join with metadata
valMeta <- eh[['EH8404']]
valMeta <- left_join(valMeta, preds, by="Sample_ID")

# visualize results
plot_predictions <- function(df, predicted_class_column) {
  df %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(
      aes(x = Class, y = EOPE),
      width = 0.3,
      alpha = 0.5,
      color = "darkgrey"
    ) +
    geom_jitter(
      aes(x = Class, y = EOPE, color = {{predicted_class_column}}), 
      alpha = 0.75, 
      position = position_jitter(width = .1)
    ) + 
    coord_flip() +
    ylab("Class Probability of EOPE") +
    xlab("True Class") +
    ylim(0,1) +
    scale_color_manual(
      name = "Predicted Class", 
      values = c("#E69F00", "skyblue", "#999999")
    ) + 
    theme_minimal() 
}
```

```{r, fig.width = 7}
valMeta %>% plot_predictions(PE_Status)
```


if user wishes to use different threshold from 55% probability, as an example 70%

```{r, fig.width = 7}
valMeta %>% mutate(
  Pred_Class = case_when(
    EOPE > 0.7 ~ "EOPE",
    `Non-PE Preterm` > 0.7 ~ "Non-PE Preterm",
    .default = 'low-confidence'
  )) %>% plot_predictions(Pred_Class)

```
